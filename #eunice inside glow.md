#Eunice Inside Glow

Title: Eunice Inside Glow

Brand overview: Empowering women by connecting their inner-self with the outer-self. This page will be about building a women community to help and guide them through re-shaping the way they see themselves. 

Brand steps: The self-Image discovery : I found one of the most powerful tools in this world: Self-Image 
The way you perceive yourself can either open unimaginable doors or limit you completely. 
The only way to change your outside world is to reconnect with your inner self and build habits that align with your higher version. 

About Eunice: PASSIONATE ABOUT WOMEN’S TRANSFORMATION.
For 10 years I worked as a hairstylist, believing that if women looked good on the outside, their lives would feel perfect.
But through thousands of conversations in the beauty industry, I discovered something deeper: true satisfaction doesn’t come only from looking good.
It comes from how we see ourselves. 

Why I created HERA? 
Out of this vision, HERA Hair Essentials was born.
More than products, it’s a ritual: talking to yourself while looking in the mirror, embracing your worth, and caring for your hair with high-quality natural ingredients.
After 3 years walking this new journey, I feel ready to help women in many ways.
If you feel connected to this mission, welcome to this beautiful community where we raise our voices and say:
“This is me, and I accept myself for the gift that I am —
the power to create, to shine, and to design the life
I deserve.”
